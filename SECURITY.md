## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, please report it to us privately. **Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to:

**`security@[your_domain_or_email].com`** (Replace with your actual security contact email)

*Alternative (if using GitHub): You can also use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature if enabled for this repository.*

Please include the following details in your report:

* A clear description of the vulnerability.
* Steps to reproduce the vulnerability. Include code snippets or screenshots if helpful.
* The potential impact of the vulnerability (e.g., data exposure, denial of service).
* The version(s) of the application affected.
* Any potential mitigation or suggested fix (if known).

We will endeavor to acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours and provide a timeline for addressing it.

## Disclosure Policy

We aim to publicly disclose vulnerabilities once a fix has been developed and deployed, coordinating with the reporter where possible.

## Scope

This security policy applies to the Flutter application code found within this repository and any backend services (like Cloud Functions) specifically developed and maintained for this project by the core team.

## Out of Scope

The following are generally considered out of scope:

* Vulnerabilities in underlying third-party dependencies (unless exploited in a unique way specific to this application). Please report these to the dependency maintainers directly.
* Vulnerabilities requiring physical access to a user's device.
* Denial of service attacks against Firebase infrastructure (report these to Google Cloud).
* Social engineering attacks.
* Missing security best practices that do not lead to a direct, exploitable vulnerability.

Thank you for helping keep Basatong and its users safe.
